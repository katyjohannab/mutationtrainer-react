# External Agent Workflow

Last updated: 2026-02-18

## PARKED
This workflow is parked.

Reason:
- Active app workflow is now CSV-first runtime authoring.
- JS unit-data generation is retained but not part of day-to-day operation.

Use active docs instead:
- `docs/DOCS_INDEX.md`
- `docs/CONTENT_WORKFLOW.md`
- `docs/AI_DATA_ENTRY_PROMPT.md`
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
