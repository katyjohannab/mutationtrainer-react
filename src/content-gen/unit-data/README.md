# Unit Data Layout (Parked)

Last updated: 2026-02-18

## PARKED
This directory belongs to the parked JS generator workflow.

Current active runtime/content workflow is CSV-first and uses:
- `public/data/...` unit CSV files
- `src/data/dysguUnitRegistry.js` registration

These files are retained for potential future scale-up and should not be deleted without an explicit migration decision.

See active docs:
- `docs/DOCS_INDEX.md`
- `docs/CONTENT_WORKFLOW.md`
